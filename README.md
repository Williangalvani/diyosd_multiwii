diyosd_multiwii
===============

This is a diyosd port for communication with multiwii board

The original Project is available at the thread: http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1473207

So far: 
- The multiwii protocol has been implemented, based the multiwii's own serial.c (with minor changes)
- Lots of features from 0.18 were removed, for different reasons
- An artificial horizon has been implemented

coming soon:
 - test with real hardware (so far the serial communication has fake data)
